2. Install the JS SDK:

```bash
## NPM
npm install @1password/sdk

## PNPM
pnpm add @1password/sdk

## Yarn
yarn add @1password/sdk
```

5. Use the SDK in your project:

```js
import { createClient } from "@1password/sdk";

// create an authenticated client
const client = await createClient({
    auth: "<your_service_account_token>",
    integrationName: "<your_integration_name>",
    integrationVersion: "<your_integration_version>",
});

// fetch secret
const secret = await client.secrets.resolve("op://Private/Netflix/website");
```
