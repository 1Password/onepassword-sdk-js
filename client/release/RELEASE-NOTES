# 1Password JS SDK v0.3.0

## NEW

- **Support for item states**: You can now fetch an item's state using the SDK. `Item` and `ItemOverview` expose two states: `Active` and`Archived`.
    - `Active`: An item located inside a vault. (Default)
    - `Archived`: An item that has been moved to the Archive. 1Password doesn't include archived items in search results or suggest them when you fill in apps and browsers. You can keep archived items as long as you'd like.
- **Filtering the return of item listing by state**: You can now filter the listed items by item state. The current exposed filter is `ByState`, which allows devs to filter `ItemOverviews` by their `State` .

## IMPROVED

- **Improved Deleting Capabilities:** You can now delete `Archived` items in the SDKs.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES ⚠️

This release contains a breaking change for the Go SDK.

* `items.listAll()` has changed to `items.list()` and below is how to migrate.

Before:
```js
const overviews = await client.items.listAll(vault.id);
for await (const overview of overviews) {
  console.log(overview.id + " " + overview.title);
}
```

After:

```js
const overviews = await client.items.list(vault.id, {
        type: "ByState",
        content: { active: true, archived: true },
      })
for await (const overview of overviews) {
  console.log(overview.id + " " + overview.title);
}
```
* `vaults.listAll()` has changed to `vaults.list()` and the migration guide is below:

Before:
```js
const vaults = await client.vaults.listAll();
for await (const vault of vaults) {
  console.log(vault.id + " " + vault.title);
}
```

After:
```js
const vaults = await client.vaults.list();
for await (const vault of vaults) {
  console.log(vault.id + " " + vault.title);
}
```
*  All functions that return an Iterator will now return the appropriate list type.

This does not affect any code already deployed, and will not take effect in your codebase until you choose to update to v0.3.0+ of the 1Password JS SDK
