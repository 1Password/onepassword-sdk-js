# 1Password JS SDK v0.3.0

## NEW

- **Support for item states**: You can now fetch an item's state using the SDK.`ItemOverview` exposes one of two states: `Active` or `Archived`.
    - `Active`: An item located inside a vault. (Default)
    - `Archived`: An item that has been moved to the Archive. 1Password doesn't include archived items in search results or suggest them when you fill in apps and browsers. You can keep archived items as long as you'd like.
- **Filtering the return of item listing by state**: You can now filter the listed items by item state.

## FIXED

- **Deleting Archived Items:** The SDK now supports deleting items from the archive.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES ⚠️
This release contains a breaking change for the JS SDK.

**Vault listing**

* The function name has changed from `listAll` to `list`. To use this in your code, replace:
```js
const vaults = await client.vaults.listAll();
```
with
```js
const vaults = await client.vaults.list();
```

* The return type of the vault listing function has changed from `SdkIterable<VaultOverview` to `VaultOverview[]`. No changes are needed here.

**Item listing**

* The function name has changed from `listAll` to `list`. To use this in your code, replace:
```js
const overviews = await client.items.listAll(vault.id);
```
with:
```js
const overviews = await client.items.list(vault.id, {
        type: "ByState",
        content: { active: true, archived: true },
      })
```

* The return type of the item listing function has changed from `SdkIterable<ItemOverview>` to `ItemOverview[]`. No changes are needed here.

This does not affect any code that's already deployed, and will not take effect in your codebase until updating to v0.3.0+ of the 1Password JS SDK.
